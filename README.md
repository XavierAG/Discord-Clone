## Project Summary

This is a collaborative project emulating user control of Servers, channels to populate Servers, and Messages to populate Channels. We utilized Socket.io to broadcast state changes in the features, so that a one demonstrating user may see the messages of another in real time. To optionally create profile pictures for either Users or the Servers they create, we implemented Amazon Web Services to store User file input into an S3 bucket.
